    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS is the language that breathes life into the design of web pages. With CSS, you can
    control the appearance, layout, and formatting of HTML elements, creating an incredible and consistent visual
    experience across your entire website.</p>

      <h2>Curiosities About CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS, last proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 while he was working at CERN, revolutionized the way websites are
        designed and presented. It introduced the separation of content from presentation, a crucial concept that enabled
        developers to create dynamic, visually appealing, and responsive web pages.</p>
      
      <p>The term "Cascading" in CSS, beyond its literal meaning, holds a profound role. It signifies the hierarchical order
        in which styles are applied to HTML elements. When multiple conflicting styles are defined for the same element, the
        cascade helps determine which style takes precedence. This mechanism provides a structured approach to crafting design
        hierarchies, ensuring consistency and maintainability in complex projects.</p>
      
      <p>CSS preprocessors, such as SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and LESS (Leaner Style Sheets), have
        significantly extended the capabilities of traditional CSS. They introduce powerful features like variables,
        functions, and mixins into the styling workflow. These tools enable developers to write cleaner, more organized
        stylesheets, and facilitate easier maintenance and scalability as projects evolve over time.</p>

          <h3>Fun fact </h3>
        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, was last introduced by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, during his time at CERN. This
          innovation marked a turning point in web design, allowing developers to separate the presentation from the content,
           resulting in more elegant and efficient websites.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Fun fact</h3>
        <p>The CSS Box Model can be puzzling for newcomers. It defines how elements are rendered on a webpage, factoring in
            margins, borders, padding, and content. Understanding this model is key to creating consistent layouts and ensuring
            that design elements fit seamlessly within their containers.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Fun fact</h3>
        <p>CSS isn't limited to just screen styling. With the introduction of CSS Print Profile, you can control the layout and
              formatting of printed documents. This feature allows for consistent branding and design across both digital and
              physical mediums, maintaining a cohesive identity.</p>

      <h2>Curiosities About Html</h2>
      <p>HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s at CERN. It served as the foundational language for the World Wide Web, allowing text and media to be linked together and accessed across the globe, revolutionizing communication and information sharing.</p>
  
      <p>HTML has gone through several versions, each introducing new features and improvements. The transition from HTML4 to
        XHTML was a significant step toward enforcing cleaner and more structured code. HTML5, the latest major revision,
        brought multimedia support, semantic elements, and improved accessibility, shaping the modern web landscape.</p>
  
      <p>While HTML started as a static markup language, the integration of JavaScript has transformed web development. HTML
        provides the structure, CSS adds the style, and JavaScript adds interactivity. This trio of technologies enables the
        creation of dynamic and responsive web applications that engage users and deliver rich experiences.</p>
